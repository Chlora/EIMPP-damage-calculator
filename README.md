This repository is almost entirely a clone of Smogon's damage calculator (https://github.com/smogon/damage-calc), with modified javascript, css and html files to fit my friend (Lamp's) own EIPP game.

I left the license in just in case, but i don't really understand what anything other than the above mentioned file types do. 
Huge thanks to Celestia (celestia74) for giving me directions on how to host the modified calculator here on github (first time using it) and giving me the rundown of the file structures and such

You can use this calculator at file:///C:/Users/rodri/Desktop/dist/index.template.html 



Despite the fact that i had a good amount of knowledge on CSS, HTML and JS, it's VERY easy to make your own modification of the calculator, since what is already written is easy to understand and replicate through examples of the already written code. 
If you're looking to host one for your own project, don't be scared! It's much easier than it seems. You can find the full instructions in the damage calculator repository (linked above).


Please contact me on discord (chlora_) if there's any bugs or something that needs fixing/polishing!
